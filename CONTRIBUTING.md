## 📐 Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React
```javascript
// Use arrow functions for components
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>Content</div>;
};

// Use meaningful variable names
const studentList = []; // Good
const arr = []; // Bad

// Add comments for complex logic
// Filter students by year to get active students
const activeStudents = students.filter(s => s.year <= 4);
```

### Tailwind CSS
```jsx
// Use Tailwind classes directly
<div className="p-4 bg-blue-500 rounded shadow">

// Group related classes
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-green-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-green-600">
```

### File Naming
- Components: `PascalCase.jsx` (e.g., `StudentTable.jsx`)
- Utilities: `camelCase.js` (e.g., `apiHelper.js`)
- Styles: `kebab-case.css` (e.g., `student-card.css`)
